# Motioncraft

> A comprehensive VR and motion control system for World of Warcraft (or any game), combining VR controller mapping with gesture-based commands detected through a webcam.

## Overview

This project consists of three interconnected components that work together:

- **VR Controller Interface** - Uses WebXR to map VR controller inputs to WoW actions
- **Motion Detection System** - Uses MediaPipe Pose to recognize physical motions via webcam
- **Input Server** - Translates VR and motion inputs into keyboard/mouse commands for WoW

The system allows you to play any game using controller movements for navigation and camera control, while also performing custom motions (like raising your arm) to trigger in-game abilities.

## Features

### VR Controller Interface

- Full mapping of Oculus/Meta Quest controllers to WoW controls
- Left controller for movement (forward/back/strafe/jump)
- Right controller for camera control and targeting
- Trigger and grip buttons for mouse clicks
- Face buttons for ability activation
- Visual feedback of active controls

### Motion Detection System

- Record, save, and recognize custom body motions
- Gesture analysis with advanced matching algorithms
- Joint importance editor for fine-tuning recognition
- Location-invariant tracking (works regardless of your position in the room)
- Motion-to-key mapping for triggering abilities with gestures
- Visual recording and playback tools

### Input Server

- WebSocket-based communication between components
- Translates VR and motion controls to keyboard/mouse inputs
- Supports keyboard shortcuts, mouse movement, and button clicks
- Auto-reconnect capabilities

## Requirements

- VR headset compatible with WebXR (Oculus Quest, HTC Vive, etc.)
- Webcam for motion detection
- Python 3.6+ with Flask
- Modern web browser supporting WebXR
- The game you want to play ðŸ˜„

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/tonytodo0/motioncraft
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```
   pip install flask flask-sock keyboard pywin32
   ```

3. Start the input server from the input folder:
   ```
   python wow_input_server.py
   ```

4. Start the VR interface from the input folder:
   ```
   http-server . -p 8080 --cors
   ```

5. Start the Camera User Interface from the cam folder:
   ```
   node server.js
   ```

## Usage

### Setting Up VR Controls

1. Start the input server (`python wow_input_server.py`)
2. Open the VR interface in a browser (http://localhost:8080)
3. Click "Enter VR" to start the VR session
4. Use the left controller thumbstick for movement
5. Use the right controller thumbstick for camera control
6. Use trigger and grip buttons for mouse clicks
7. Use the face buttons (A, B, X, Y) for abilities

### Recording Custom Motions

1. Open the motion detection system in a browser (http://localhost:3000)
2. Use the "Record" button or press 'R' to start recording a motion, or the "B" key on your right VR Controller
3. Perform the motion you want to record
4. Press "Stop", click 'S' or press the "B" key on your Controller again to save the motion
5. Name your motion when prompted

### Mapping Motions to Keys

1. In the motion detection interface, click "Mappings"
2. Select a recorded motion from the dropdown
3. Enter the key to trigger (e.g., "1", "shift+f", "ctrl+3")
4. Select the desired behavior (press and release, hold, or toggle)
5. Click "Save Mapping"

### Using Motion Controls

1. Hold the left trigger on your VR controller
2. Perform the motion you recorded
3. Release the trigger to execute the mapped key command

## Advanced Configuration

### Joint Importance Editor

Fine-tune which joints are most important for recognizing each motion:

1. Click "Analysis" in the motion detection interface
2. Select a motion and click "Edit Joint Importance"
3. Adjust sliders to give more or less weight to different joints
4. Higher values make that joint more important for recognition

### Motion Detection Thresholds

Adjust how sensitive the system is to motions:

- **Min Movement**: Minimum movement required to register a motion
- **Match Threshold**: How closely a motion must match to be recognized
- **Motion Duration**: Minimum time for a valid motion
- **Duration Weight**: How important timing is to recognition
